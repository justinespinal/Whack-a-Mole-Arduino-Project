# Whack-a-Mole-Arduino-Project

Hi! This is my physical Whack-A-Mole game! Unfortunately, back when I made this project I did not take any footage of the final product because I did not have access to a phone and wasnt able to capture it functioning.

This code fully displays my understanding of the functionality of leds, buttons, buzzers, bread boards, and ardunio software code itself. So if you have a spare cherry pie and bread board lying around, feel free to try to beat my game! The objective is to beat the game in under 2 minutes by scoring 30 points; 1 point for each mole you whack!

Good luck!
